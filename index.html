            <h2>Worst Updates:</h2>
            <p>Roblox has made to sell plug-ins by real-world money. They can be making selling models by real-world money but I don't have much evedience. If you are a brazilian plug-in creator, well, you cannot anymore. Roblox is BANNING people under the age of 13. Why is that? Cause, in florida, USA, people under age 13 cannot use social media. Now this is world wide. Roblox has also added 21+ games. In the future, Roblox is removing ROBUX from their game. Maybe the gamepasses will cost but real-world money. Roblox has also collaborated with Fortnite. Nobody knows why Roblox collaborated with Fortnite but, they did. Maybe bacon hair will be available in Fortnite. And the most saddest part is.. Roblox is getting PAID soon... Their games maybe get paid to play. Just kidding, roblox isn't getting paid. But their robux will be removed and be real money or something. Don't have enough evidence.</p>

            <h2>Medium Updates (Some people hate it, some people don't):</h2>
            <p>Roblox has added a new home page style, it could be a test from Roblox to see if people hate it or not. Well, some people hate this update but some people are saying, "This update is really cool, everything is organized.". And the haters are saying, "Is there a option in the settings to toggle the old version?".</p>
